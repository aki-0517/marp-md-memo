# Genome Assembly Notes and Presentation Drafts

This repository is dedicated to documenting the experimental process, notes, and presentation drafts for the genome assembly of *Dictyostelium discoideum* using long-read sequencing technologies. The workflow and strategies are based on the protocol described in the paper:

> "A beginner's guide to assembling a draft genome and analyzing structural variants with long-read sequencing technologies" (Kim & Kim, Cell Press, 2022)

## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive memo and workspace for:
- Recording experimental progress and results
- Drafting and organizing presentation materials
- Storing scripts, commands, and configuration files used in the assembly and analysis process
- Comparing and evaluating different assembly strategies and tools

## Background
The main objective is to construct a high-quality draft genome and enable structural variant (SV) analysis for *Dictyostelium discoideum*, following the best practices outlined in the referenced Cell Press protocol. The project utilizes Oxford Nanopore (ONT) long-read data, complemented by Illumina short reads, to achieve a contiguous and accurate genome assembly.

## Contents
- Experimental notes and step-by-step records
- Comparative analysis of assembly tools (Canu, Flye, Raven, Shasta, etc.)
- Polishing strategies and evaluation metrics (N50, BUSCO, etc.)
- Roadmaps and strategies for further analysis (SV detection, gene annotation)
- Drafts for presentations and scripts for oral/poster sessions
